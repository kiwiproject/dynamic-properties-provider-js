Dynamic Properties Provider is a utility library to assist in the generation of field definitions based on model classes. This process is helpful if a UI needs to build dynamic forms based on models in a service but don't want to hardcode all the fields of the models in the UI. This is a port of the Java library with the same name. (https://github.com/kiwiproject/dynamic-properties-provider).
